# GAMES

Building some classic terminal based games using python.

### Motivation

I am doing this just for the fun of it.


## Acey Ducey

Card game where the dealer deals two cards, face up, while the player has to guess whether the value of the third card will be in between the two previously dealt cards or not, and place a bet on it.

The game ends when the player interrupts the normal running of the program or when player runs out of money.

Player can choose the starting money or go with the default 100 dollars.
